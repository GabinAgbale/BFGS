## Implementation of Newton and quasi-Newton Gradient Descent

This repository contains an implementation of Newton and quasi-Newton gradient descent methods. These algorithms are applied to a linear regression task, with detailed demonstrations available in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.
This project was conducted as part of the "Optimization for Machine Learning" course ([G. Peyre](https://github.com/gpeyre)), at the Master MASH, PSL University.
